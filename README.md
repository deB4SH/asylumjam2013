Jam-Site: http://www.asylumjam.com/

This is just a developement Repository for a horror-game done for the AsylumJam from OCTOBER 11th to OCTOBER 13th.
For 100% this will be a post-jam completion. Thats the reason why we wont try to finish it in the timeframe and make it more fancy instead.

You also are allowed to help us on damn issues and silly things
